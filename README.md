# Handwritten Digit Recognition 

## Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Two models, a Sequential model and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), were implemented and tested to compare their performance.

## Models

### Sequential Model

- Architecture: Dense layers for flattening and processing features.

### CNN Model

- Architecture: Utilized convolutional and pooling layers for spatial feature extraction.
